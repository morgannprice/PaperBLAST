# Valine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathway L-valine biosynthesis
# (metacyc:VALSYN-PWY).

# ilvIH (or ilvGM) is a two-subunit enzyme that forms acetolactate or acetohydroxybutanoate.
# (S)-2-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoate synthesis is part of isoleucine biosynthesis.
# Acetolactate synthesis is part of valine or leucine biosynthesis.
# CH_124129 is probably correct but has limited data and vaguer annotations.
# IlvX from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (uniprot:O53554) is ignored because, although
# annotated with this activity by both SwissProt and BRENDA, we could not find
# experimental evidence, and it is reported to
# lack activity (PMID:20884690).

# The isolated catalytic subunit can have some activity on its own, so it's not clear if the regulatory
# subunit (ilvH) is always required, but ilvH does always seem to be present.
# uniprot:P0ADG1 is annotated with this EC number but not explicitly as the small regulatory subunit,
# so it was added manually.
# uniprot:Q93YZ7 is annotated as this but without the EC number, so is added manually.
# Most regulatory subunits have an N-terminal ACT domain and a C-terminal ACT-like domain,
# but E. coli IlvM, which is required for the activity of E. coli acetohydroxyacid synthase isoenzyme II,
# has the N-terminal ACT domain only.
# We identified several other short (one-domain) regulatory subunits.
# In Rhodanobacter and related genera, the putative regulatory subunit has
# just one ACT domain (i.e., LRK54_RS10305, which is nearly identical to A0A154R0Y7).
# Based on sequence analysis, short ilvH probably maintains the ability to bind
# valine and to bind the catalytic subunit, but not the ability to bind ATP or other regulatory subunits.
# Mutant fitness data confirms that LRK54_RS10305 is involved in amino acid biosynthesis.
# In Xanthomonas campestris, the one ACT-domain protein Xcc-8004.1058.1 (uniprot:A0A0H2X4P1), which
# is conserved next to ilvI, has a similar fitness pattern as ilvI (Alice Castaing, unpublished data).
# Furthermore, its AlphaFold structure is
# very similar to that of E. coli IlvM (TM-score 0.89, RMSD 1.49 A, foldseek).
# So Xcc-8004.1058.1 is another short regulatory subunit.
# Similarly, in Brevundimonas sp. GW460-12-10-14-LB2, the putative ilvH has the ACT domain only
# (Brev2_1981 = A0A161J739).
# Many Thermoproteota seem to have a diverged short regulatory subunit, such as the ACT domain protein
# KCR_RS03285 (uniprot:A0A7J3AYJ4), which is conserved next to ilvI. Foldseek shows that this protein
# is similar to the ACT domain of (p)ppGpp synthase but also to IlvH of Staphylococcus aureus,
# so we predict that it is the regulatory subunit.
