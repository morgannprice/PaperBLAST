# Chorismate is the starting point for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids
# phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.
# Chorismate biosynthesis in GapMind is based on 
# MetaCyc pathways chorismate biosynthesis I (metacyc:ARO-PWY), from
# D-erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, or
# II (metacyc:PWY-6165), from D-glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate and L-asparatate.
# Both pathways are identical after they reach 3-dehydroquinate.

# This is also known as DAHP (3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate) synthase.
# Add CA265_RS11635 (a fusion with chorismate mutase) because it is diverged,
# is confirmed by cofitness, and is essential in other Bacteroidetes.
# uniprot:P39912 (Bacillus subtilis aroA) is annotated in BRENDA as chorismate mutase but it also has this activity
# (PMC1198938).
# CH_123440 is annotated as this but without the EC number.
# 4.1.2.15 is an obsolete EC number, but it appears in a few entries, so is ignored.
# uniprot:C9K7C8 is annotated as this in SwissProt but its function is uncertain, so it is ignored.
