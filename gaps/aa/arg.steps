# Arginine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-arginine biosynthesis I via L-acetyl-ornithine (metacyc:ARGSYN-PWY),
# II (acetyl cycle) (metacyc:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY),
# III via N-acetyl-L-citrulline (metacyc:PWY-5154),
# or IV via LysW-ornithine (metacyc:PWY-7400).
# GapMind also includes L-arginine biosynthesis with succinylated intermediates, as in Bacteroidetes (PMC5764234).
# These pathways all involve the activation of glutamate (by aceylation, succinylation, or attachment of LysW),
# followed by phosphorylation, reduction and transamination, to activated ornithine.
# In most pathways, this intermediate is cleaved to ornithine before transcarbamoylation,
# but in the N-acetylcitrulline or succinylated pathways, transcarbamoylation occurs before hydrolysis.
# In the final two steps, citrulline is converted to arginine by ArgG and ArgH.

# Bacteroidetes have a divergent N-acylglutamate synthase, see BT3761 (uniprot:Q8A1A5_BACTN)
# or Echvi_3845 (uniprot:L0G3H4_ECHVK).
# Bacteroides use succinylated intermediates (PMID:16704984), so their proteins are probably
# N-succinylglutamate synthases.
# (These enzymes are also known as argA2, see PMC9026213.)
# uniprot:A0A0H2X8L7 is annotated as argB in BRENDA, but it is also argA (a fusion protein).
# N515DRAFT_3768 (uniprot:A0A1I2DIM7) is similar to ArgAB fusion proteins and mutants are rescued by arginine.

### Bacteroidetes pathway with succinylated intermediates
# This pathway is inferrred from a N-succinylornithine
# carbamoyltransferase (argF'B; EC 2.1.3.11) -- see
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16704984
# As discussed above the N-acylglutamate synthase (ArgA) is diverged
# and apparently acts forms N-succinylglutamate instead.  The next
# steps (ArgB and ArgC) might not be specific for N-acetyl
# vs. N-succinyl substrates, or the Bacteroidetes genes may have
# adapted to prefer N-succinyl intermediates.  The conversion of
# N-succinylgutamate semialdehyde to N-succinylornithine is probably
# carried out by a diverged argD (argD'B below), which would produce
# the substrate for argF'B.  And a diverged desuccinylase (argE'B
# below) probably acts on N-succinylornithine, because these
# Bacteroidetes have ordinary argG/argH for the conversion of
# ornithine to arginine

# N-succinylglutamate semialdehyde => N-succinylornithine.
# Some Bacteroides hvae a diverged argD-like gene, i.e. BT3758 (uniprot:Q8A1A8) or Echvi_3848 (uniprot:L0G5F2_ECHVK),
# which are auxotrophic and cofit with other arg genes.
# Note that this is the same reaction as found in arginine degradation by the arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway
