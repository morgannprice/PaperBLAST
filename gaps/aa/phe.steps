# Phenylalanine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-phenylalanine biosynthesis I (metacyc:PHESYN),
# II (metacyc:PWY-3462), and III (metacyc:PWY-7432).
# Pathways I and III proceed via 3-phenyl-2-oxopropanoate, but with different
# amino acids providing the amino group for the conversion to phenylalanine.
# In pathway II, L-arogenate is the intermediate (the aminotransferase reaction occurs before the dehydratase reaction).

PPYAT	tyrosine:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase	EC:2.6.1.57

# Chorismate mutase is usually fused to prephenate dehydratase, which
# makes it difficult to find this activity when it is fused to something else. 
# As of March 2019, the PFam does not have any characterized members with other functions

# prephenate dehydratase and arogenate dehydratase can be difficult to distinguish.
# BT3936 (uniprot:Q8A0T5_BACTN) is diverged but has auxotrophic phenotypes (as do homologs Echvi_0123, CA265_RS11630).
# HVO_0449 (uniprot:D4GRZ0) is a phenylalanine auxotroph and is probably prephenate dehydratase (PMC4300041).
