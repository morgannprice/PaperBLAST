Requirements for setting up the web site:

Various perl libraries: CGI, DBI, File::stat, HTTP::Request,
IO::Handle, JSON, LWP::Simple, LWP::UserAgent, Digest::MD5,
Time::HiRes, URI::Escape, XML::LibXML, IO::String, and BioPerl (for
Bio::SeqIO).

sqlite3 must be installed

bin/ cgi/ lib/ static/ should match the code repository

The tmp/ subdirectory and the tmp/cache/ subdirectories should exist
and be writable by the web server.

For treeSites.cgi to work, the tmp/aln subdirectory should exist and
be writable by the web server.

The data/ subdirectory should contain the uniq.faa BLAST database, the
litsearch.db sqlite3 database, and stats. These files are built by the
PaperBLAST pipeline (and more specifically by the last step,
run_final.pl) into work/data. They will need to be moved to where the
CGI scripts can see them.

The bin/blast directory should contain various BLAST executables
(including fastacmd, bl2seq, and blastall).

For genomeSearch.cgi to work also requires a usearch executable to be
in bin/usearch.  Version 10.0 (32-bit) has been tested; later versions
will probably work as well.

For treeSites.cgi to work also requires executables for MUSCLE 3 and
FastTree 2 in bin/muscle3 and bin/FastTree.

For hmmSearch.cgi to work also requires static/pfam and
static/tigrfam:

static/pfam should contain PFam models, i.e. PF00001.21.hmm
(These can be built from Pfam-A.hmm by using hmmfetch.)

static/tigrfam should contain TIGRFam models,
i.e. tigrfam/TIGR00001.hmm

For vspdb.cgi to work also requires vspdb/unhit.tsv (which does not
have a clean pipeline yet, but is available in the code repository)

Optionally, use motd to show a "message of the day" at the top of the
main page and some other pages.

For fetching gene or genomes from MicrobesOnline, it is necessary to
have a local sqlite3 copy of MicrobesOnline, in
static/MicrobesOnline.sqlite3

For fetching genomes from JGI's IMG (such as to search within them
with Curated BLAST), it is necessary for private/.JGI.info to contain
a valid IMG username and password (on the 1st two lines).  Make sure
that the web server does not provide access to files in the private/
directory.  If using apache, the private/.htaccess sile hould read
"Deny to all").

For querying NCBI, it is recommended to put an NCBI API key in
private/.NCBI.api_key as a single line. For documentation about
NCBI's API keys see
https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities/

Several of the fetching tools (as used within Curated BLAST) require
LWP::Protocol::https.

For treeSites.cgi, put the FastTree executable, from
  http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/FastTree
in bin/ and put the MUSCLE 3 executable from
  https://drive5.com/muscle/downloads_v3.htm
in bin/muscle3
