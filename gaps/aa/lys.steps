# Lysine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc
# pathways L-lysine biosynthesis I via diaminopimelate (DAP) and
# succinylated intermediates (metacyc:DAPLYSINESYN-PWY),
# II with DAP and acetylated intermediates (metacyc:PWY-2941),
# III with DAP and no blocking group (metacyc:PWY-2942),
# V via 2-aminoadipate and LysW carrier protein (metacyc:PWY-3081),
# and VI with DAP aminotransferase (metacyc:PWY-5097).
# Most of these pathways involve tetrahydrodipicolinate
# and meso-diaminopimelate, with variations in how the amino group is introduced.
# Pathway V instead involves L-2-aminoadipate and LysW-attached intermediates.
# Lysine biosynthesis IV (metacyc:LYSINE-AMINOAD-PWY), via 2-aminoadipate and saccharopine,
# is only reported to occur in eukaryotes and is not described here.
