Changes to amino acid biosynthesis since the original 2019
publication:

arg: Better describe the lysW-based pathway and argX.

ile: Improved definition of cimA.

lys: Improved the lysW-based pathway to include genes from
Thermococcus kodakarensis.

met: Added the core methionine synthase mesB, the mesD-mesX system,
and renamed metE' to mesA.

phe: Improved definition of prephenate dehydratase.

pro: Added synthesis via ornithine gamma-aminotransferase (EC
2.6.1.13), and allow more options for ornithine biosynthesis (such as
the lysW pathway).

tyr: Improved definition of prephenate dehydrogenase.
