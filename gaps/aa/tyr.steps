# Tyrosine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-tyrosine biosynthesis I via 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate (metacyc:TYRSYN),
# pathway II via L-arogenate (metacyc:PWY-3461),
# pathway III via L-arogenate (metacyc:PWY-6120),
# or pathway IV via phenylalanine (metacyc:PWY-6134).
# Pathway II and III are identical except that different cofactors are used by
# L-arogenate dehydrogenase; these are not distinguished in GapMind.
# Pathways I and II/III both involve prephenate; in pathway I, prephenate is
# oxidized to hydroxyphenylpyruvate before being aminated, while in II/III, prephenate
# is aminated to arogenate before being oxidized to tyrosine.
# These alternatives are difficult to distinguish by sequence analysis.
# MetaCyc describes pathway IV as occuring in metazoa, but it
# also seems to be the main path to tyrosine in some aerobic bacteria
# (PMC7311316).

# and Ga0059261_2298 (uniprot:A0A1L6J750) are auxotrophic
# and have prephenate dehydrogenase domains (pfam:PF02153), but their specificity is unclear.
# HVO_1312 (uniprot:D4GXG3) is auxotrophic for tyrosine and is probably a prephenate dehydrogenase (PMC4300041).
# uniprot:P06959 is misannotated in BRENDA and is ignored.
# Ac3H11_2575 (uniprot:A0A162F6L0) has auxotrophic phenotypes but its specificity is unclear.
# uniprot:Q92MG1 was confirmed by binding tyrosine in a crystal structure (PDB:4wji).
# In Desulfarculus, the enzyme is a bit diverged (E1QE65), but has conserved tyrosine binding residues and
#  is in a conserved operon with aromatic amino acid biosynthesis genes.
# In Nitrosopumilus maritimus, NMAR_RS02920 (uniprot:A9A228) is diverged but is in a conserved operon
# with chorismate synthase.

# The specificity of the aminotransferase is difficult to predict.
# Include EC:2.6.1.1 (aspartate amnotransferase) because it is reported to act on aromatic amino acids including tyrosine.
# uniprot:P12343 is a fragment.
# metacyc:MONOMER-15919 and metacyc:MONOMER-15918 are involved in phosphoserine formation and it is not clear if they

# uniprot:H7CE71 appears to be misannotated in BRENDA and is ignored.
# uniprot:A0A060PQX5 and uniprot:Q845W8 are very similar to proteins with this activity, and might have
