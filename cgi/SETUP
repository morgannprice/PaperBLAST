Requirements for setting up the web site:

Various perl libraries: CGI, DBI, File::stat, HTTP::Request,
IO::Handle, JSON, LWP::Simple, LWP::UserAgent, Digest::MD5,
Time::HiRes, URI::Escape, XML::LibXML

sqlite3 must be installed

bin/ cgi/ lib/ static/ should match the code repository

The tmp/ subdirectory should be writable by the web server

The data/ subdirectory should contain the uniq.faa BLAST database, the
litsearch.db sqlite3 database, and stats. These files are built by the
PaperBLAST pipeline (and more specifically by the last step,
run_final.pl) into work/data. They will need to be moved to where the
CGI scripts can see them.

The bin/blast directory should contain various BLAST executables
(including fastacmd, bl2seq, and blastall).

For genomeSearch.cgi to work also requires a usearch executable to be
in bin/usearch.  Version 10.0 (32-bit) has been tested; later versions
will probably work as well.

For hmmSearch.cgi to work also requires static/pfam and
static/tigrfam:

static/pfam should contain PFam models, i.e. PF00001.21.hmm
(These can be built from Pfam-A.hmm by using hmmfetch.)

static/tigrfam should contain TIGRFam models,
i.e. tigrfam/TIGR00001.hmm

For vspdb.cgi to work also requires vspdb/unhit.tsv (which does not
have a clean pipeline yet, but is available in the code repository)

Optionally, use motd to show a "message of the day" at the top of the
main page and some other pages.

For fetching genomes from JGI's IMG (such as to search within them
with Curated BLAST), it is necessary for private/.JGI.info to contain
a valid IMG username and password (on the 1st two lines).  Make sure
that the web server does not provide access to files in the private/
directory.  If using apache, the private/.htaccess sile hould read
"Deny to all").

Several of the fetching tools (as used within Curated BLAST) require
LWP::Protocol::https.
