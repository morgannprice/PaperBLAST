# Phenylalanine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-phenylalanine biosynthesis I (metacyc:PHESYN),
# II (metacyc:PWY-3462), and III (metacyc:PWY-7432).
# Pathways I and III proceed via 3-phenyl-2-oxopropanoate, but with different
# amino acids providing the amino group for the conversion to phenylalanine.
# In pathway II, L-arogenate is the intermediate (the aminotransferase reaction occurs before the dehydratase reaction).

# These enzymes are usually annotated as aromatic-amino-acid transaminase, but only
# the activity on phenylpyruvate (to form phenylalanine) is relevant here.
# Phenylalanine is also considered a substrate for aspartate aminotransferases, 
# uniprot:P39643 is annotated with this EC number but is involved in bacilysin biosynthesis and
# probably wouldn't form phenylalanine.
# uniprot:H7CE71 is misannotated as this in BRENDA.
# metacyc:PHETRANTHAUERA-MONOMER has this activity but is annotated with a different EC number.
# uniprot:A0A060PQX5 has this activity but is given a different EC number in BRENDA.
# metacyc:MONOMER-15918 and uniprot:Q93QX0 probably do not have this activity.
# Many branched-chain or tryptophan transaminases are also active on phenylalanine so any similarity to them is ignored.
# Ignore the very short protein uniprot:P12343

# Chorismate mutase is usually fused to prephenate dehydratase, which
# makes it difficult to find this activity when it is fused to something else, so
# we included the entire pfam in the step's definition. 
# The only other function for this family that we are aware of is
# 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate mutase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of some antibiotics.
# (Proteins that are similar to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate mutases will be marked as medium-confidence
# in the results.)
# Several fusion proteins are missing this EC number in their annotations
# (uniprot:P43902, uniprot:Q74NC4, uniprot:A8AAX2)

# prephenate dehydratase and arogenate dehydratase can be difficult to distinguish.
# BT3936 (uniprot:Q8A0T5_BACTN) is diverged but has auxotrophic phenotypes (as do homologs Echvi_0123, CA265_RS11630).
# HVO_0449 (uniprot:D4GRZ0) is a phenylalanine auxotroph and is probably prephenate dehydratase (PMC4300041).
# uniprot:A0A160HWY7 from Brevundimonas is a somewhat diverged prephenate dehydratase; it has auxotrophic phenotypes.
# The putative prephenate dehydratase from Carboxydothermus pertinax (A0A1L8CUL6) is lacking
# the regulatory (ACT) domain but has the active site residues and is often encoded near aromatic amino
# acid synthesis genes (it might be an arogenate dehydratase instead).
