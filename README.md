PaperBLAST is a tool to find papers about homologs of a protein of interest. For an example see

http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/litSearch.cgi?query=VIMSS14484

This code base also includes Curated BLAST for Genomes, GapMind, SitesBLAST, and Sites on a Tree.

# System Requirements

These scripts should work on any Linux system, and would probably work
on other Unix or MacOS as well. All of the code is written in perl. (I am using perl v5.10.1 or perl v5.16.3.)

# Installation

(These instructions are for PaperBLAST and Curated BLAST for Genomes. If you want to install GapMind, see the SETUP file in the gaps/ directory.)

Please put the blast executables (formatdb, blastall, and fastacmd) in
the bin/blast/ subdirectory. I am currently using NCBI BLAST 2.2.18.

Please put the usearch executable in the bin/ subdirectory. I am
currently using usearch 10.0.

If you want to build a database, put the cd-hit executable in the bin/
subdirectory. I am currently using cd-hit 4.7.

The cgi/ subdirectory contains the common gateway interface script,
litSearch.cgi, which is the interface for using PaperBLAST.

For litSearch.cgi to work, the data/ subdirectory must include the
sqlite3 database and the protein BLAST database. These are both built
by bin/run_final.pl (which invokes bin/buildLitDb.pl).

Create a tmp/ subdirectory and set it to writable by the web server
(or by everyone) so that litSearch.cgi can write to ../tmp/ (relative
to the directory that it is invoked from, which is usually the cgi
directory)

# Dependencies

sqlite3 is required

The swissknife perl library must be in the SWISS subdirectory (so that
the *.pm files are in SWISS/lib/SWISS/). It is available at

http://swissknife.sourceforge.net/docs/
https://sourceforge.net/projects/swissknife/files/latest/download

As of June 2025, we are using swissknife version 1.81.

Finally, PaperBLAST uses these standard Perl libraries:

Getopt::Long
FindBin
File::Which
IO::Handle
XML::LibXML
JSON
POSIX
Time::HiRes
LWP::Simple
LWP::Protocol::https
URI::Escape
CGI
DBI

The functional residues part of the alignment page (at bottom of
showAlign.cgi) requires BioPerl. (See alnreport.pl) The page should
work correctly without bioperl but would not report the conservation
of functional residues.

SitesBLAST (sites.cgi) also requires BioPerl.

# <a name="download"></a>Downloading the database

The April 2017 version of the PaperBLAST database is available at

https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4836407

The current database is available as a FASTA file and a sqlite3
relational database (1.5 GB as of July 2017)

http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/data/uniq.faa

http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/data/litsearch.db

If you want to run the CGI scripts, you will also need

http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/data/stats

If you want to run SitesBLAST, you will also need

http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/data/hassites.faa

Place all of these files in the data/ subdirectory of the main PaperBLAST directory and format the BLAST databases with

	formatdb -p T -o T -i data/uniq.faa
	formatdb -p T -o T -i data/hassites.faa

# Building the Database

The database can be built with the following series of scripts. As of
March 2017, the process requires approximately 324 GB of free disk
space and takes around a week to run. The majority of the time is for
querying EuropePMC.

Download information from RefSeq, UniProt, EcoCyc, EuropePMC,
EcoCyc, PubMed, PDBSum, wwPDB, BioLiP:

	mkdir indata
	nice bin/download.pl -dir indata >& download.log

Before running download.pl, you will need to either download ecoli.tar.gz manually from EcoCyc and put it in the current directory, or, set up a file named ecocyc.URL in the current directory that contains a valid URL to fetch
ecoli.tar.gz. The contents of ecocyc.URL would look something like
http://biocyc-flatfiles:data-12345@bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ecocyc/dist/flatfiles-12345678/ecoli.tar.gz but you will need to register at EcoCyc to get a valid URL.

Choose which queries to run against EuropePMC:

	mkdir work
	nice bin/run_terms.pl -in indata -work work >& run_terms.log

Run all the queries against EuropePMC:

	nice bin/run_search.pl -in indata -work work >& run_search.log

Extract snippets:

	nice bin/run_snippets.pl -in indata -work work >& run_snippets.log

Before using run_snippets, you should set up a key for the elsevier API
and a token for the CrossRef API. These should go in the cache/ directory, in files named elsevier key and crossref_token.

The cache/ directory is also where the articles that are downloaded
from the Elsevier API or from Crossref are stored. They are stored as
cache_nnnn.pdf or .xml, where the number is the pubmed id. If you use
other tools such as pubMunch2 to obtain articles, you need to rename
the PDFs to this format and put them in the cache/ directory.

Build the database:

	nice bin/run_final.pl -in indata -work work >& run_final.log

This will create the directory work/data, which will include a BLAST
database of unique protein sequences and a sqlite3 relational
database. See bin/litsearch.sql for the sqlite3 database schema. These
contents can be copied or symbolically linked to the data/ directory,
which is where the CGI scripts expect the database to be. (More
precisely, the data should be in ../data/ relative to the directory
that the CGI script is invoked from.)
