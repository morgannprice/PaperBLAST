# Isoleucine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-isoleucine biosynthesis I (from threonine) (metacyc:ILEUSYN-PWY),
# II via citramalate (metacyc:PWY-5101),
# or IV from propanoate (metacyc:PWY-5104).
# These pathways share a common intermediate, 2-oxobutanoate, but vary
# in how the 2-oxobutanoate is formed.
# Pathway IV is included because propanoate is a common fermentative
# end product and need not be a nutrient requirement, but
# it is not always clear if it could be the main pathway to
# isoleucine.
# Pathway III (metacyc:PWY-5103), via glutamate mutase,
# is not included because the first step (glutamate mutase, EC:5.4.99.1)
# has not been linked to sequence and because no organism has been
# demonstrated to rely on this pathway to form oxobutanoate.
# MetaCyc L-isoleucine biosynthesis V describes biosynthesis from 2-methylbutanoate, which
# is a fermentation end product in the rumen; this is an an unusual precursor
# so we did not include it.
