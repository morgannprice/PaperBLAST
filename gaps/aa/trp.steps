# Tryptophan biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathway
# L-tryptophan biosynthesis (metacyc:TRPSYN-PWY), from chorismate,
# glutamine, 5-phosphoribose-1-diphosphate, and serine.

# This component of anthranilate synthase is also known as the alpha subunit  or component I.
# BT0532 (uniprot:Q8AAD3_BACTN) and CA265_RS22890 (uniprot:A0A1X9ZB07_9SPHI) are also component I.
# Similarly for DVU0465 (uniprot:Q72EV3_DESVH) and DvMF_1746 (uniprot:B8DM47_DESVM).
# Some related proteins have EC:2.6.1.85 which should perhaps be ignored.
