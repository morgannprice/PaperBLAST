# Glycine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# glycine biosynthesis I from serine (metacyc:GLYSYN-PWY),
# III from glyoxylate (metacyc:GLYSYN-ALA-PWY),
# or IV from threonine (metacyc:GLYSYN-THR-PWY).
# Pathway II from methylene-tetrahydrofolate, CO2, and ammonia
# (metacyc:GLYSYN-PWY) is not included because it is not clear that bacteria really
# run this in reverse (although apparently budding yeast can).
# Glcyine synthiesis by glyXL/glyXS, whose biochemical function is not known, is also represented.
# Another pathway not listed is the formation of glycine from glycolate
# as in Pelagibacter (see PMID:23096402). This is an unusual nutritional requirement.

# Some methanogens use tetrahydromethanopterin instead of tetrahydrofolate as the folate carrier,
# which is annotated as "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase" but with a different EC number.

# CH_123497 is isocitrate lyase but is annotated without the EC number.
# uniprot:Q05957 is misannotated in BRENDA as this function; it prefers other substrates (PMID:16342929)
# uniprot:P28467 is annotated as this by two resources but is only 15 amino acids, so it is ignored.

# E. coli serA (uniprot:P0A825) is annotated in BRENDA as threonine aldolase, but other resources
# report that it is active on allothreonine only.
# CH_123166 is L-threonine aldolase but was annotated without the EC number, so it is added manually.
# uniprot:O07051 is ignored because it specific for L-allothreonine.

# Glycine synthesis by Bifidobacterium breve or Methanococcus maripaludis requires two genes:
# a putative enzyme (distantly related to anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase), which we call glyXL, and an ACT domain protein,
# which we call glyXS (BBR_RS12920 and BBR_RS12915 or MMP_RS07345 and MMP_RS03450, Anthony Shiver and Leslie Day).
# These proteins are usually encoded next to each other (although not in Methanococcus).
# A homolog of glyXL from Streptococcus (spr0218, uniprot:Q8DRD2) is also required for glycine synthesis (PMC2739083).
# Also, glyXS:glyXL is regulated by a glycine riboswitch in Bacillus methanolicus (see BMMGA3_03000 in PMC4342826).

# Required for glycine synthesis along with glyXL in Bifodobacterium breve and Methanococcus maripaludis.
# ACT domain proteins often bind amino acids to regulate the activity of enzymes, so we
# predict that glyXL is the catalytic component.
