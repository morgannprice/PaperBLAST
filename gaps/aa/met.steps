# Methionine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-methionine biosynthesis I via O-succinylhomoserine and cystathionine (metacyc:HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY),
# II via O-phosphohomoserine and cystathionine (metacyc:PWY-702),
# III via O-acetylhomoserine (metacyc:HSERMETANA-PWY),
# or IV with reductive sulfhydrylation of aspartate semialdehyde (metacyc:PWY-7977).
# These pathways vary in how aspartate semialdehyde is reduced and sulfhydrylated to homocysteine.
# GapMind does not represent the formation of the methyl donors for methionine synthase,
# such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or methyl corrinoid proteins.

# For BRENDA::O63067 -- the paper describes a monofunctional hom but the sequence of uniprot:O63067 is
# much longer and has a close homolog of functional aspartate kinase (due to alternative splicing?)

# MetX is often found alongside a methyltransferase-like protein MetW.
# Because MetW is not consistently required for MetX's activity, it is not included in GapMind.
# Details on MetW: PMID:28581482 briefly mention that
# MetX proteins lacked activity when expressed in E. coli unless MetW
# was cloned along with it. They purified MetX by adding an N-terminal
# hexahistidine tag; MetW would not necessarily be purified along with
# it. Most likely, MetW is either modifying MetX and improving its
# activity, or forming a complex with MetX and stabilizing it.  Mutant
# fitness data for MetW from various Proteobacteria shows that MetW need
# not be required for MetX activity (see Herbaspirillum seropedicae or
# Cupriavidus necator). In other organisms, MetW mutants have milder
# phenotypes than MetX mutants, or MetX mutants do not have a defect
# in some conditions, which suggests that MetW is only sometimes
# required (Burkholderia phytofirmans, Acidovorax 3H11, Dechlorosoma
# suillum PS, Marinobacter adhaerens). This might suggest that any
# modification has a regulatory role. In many other organisms, there
# is tight cofitness between MetX and MetW, suggesting that MetW is
# required for MetX's activity (Paraburkholderia bryophila, many
# Pseudomonas, Caulobacter crescentus, or Sphingomonas koreensis).
